Description:
The customer approached with the task of developing a frontend application and interface using React.js technology and MUI or Material UI library + we needed to integrate Youtube API for frontend to get the necessary data. First we converted the Figma layout into an adapted HTML layout for React.js (JSX) components (16 hours of work were spent on this task). Then we had to add registration and login logic with Google account and usual login with connection to client's database (the second stage took 32 hours, including time spent on tests). The third task was to connect Youtube Api to check the necessary data for the client (the third phase took 14 hours, including time spent on tests).
In the end, 12 edits were made related to component visualization.

Task:
- First phase of work:
1) Conversion of customer design from Figma to JSX components of React.js.

- Second phase of work:
1) Adding registration (JWT) and login modules (Google account) + regular login (MongoDB).
2) Testing registration and login modules.

- The third stage of work:
1) Connecting and integrating Youtube API.
2) Testing frontend products using Youtube API.
